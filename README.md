My solutions for advent of code exercises.

My only rules are no peeking - these exercises are completed without referring
to any other solutions, and aim at clarity and performance.

## Running the solutions:

To run a specific day, use the `bin/run` script:

```bash
./bin/run 2021 05 test
./bin/run 2021 05 pt1
./bin/run 2021 05 pt2
```

## REPL orientated development:

Start a REPL with:

```bash
rlwrap ./bin/repl 2021 05
```
